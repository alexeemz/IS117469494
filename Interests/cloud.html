              <p>Cloud Computing is the term used to describe the provision of services
              and access of data over the internet.<br></p><p><strong>What's the point?</strong><br>
              There are many benefits to Cloud Computing.<br> In the past people would run programs
              from software downloaded onto the hardrive of their own personal computer, through the cloud people can now access
              the same programs over the internet which makes software much more available and efficient!
            <br>Aswell as easier access to more programs, computing over the cloud means that you can work from anywhere and everywhere as all of your data is stored online and can be accessed from any computer connected to the internet!
